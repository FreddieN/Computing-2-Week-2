# Computing 2 â€“ Week 2
In this exercise we will get familiar with Javascript and it's
[array functions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array)
by re-attempting the Computing 1 exam in Javascript.

See if you can use array methods,
particularly, `map`, `filter`, and `reduce`
to solve these problems.
We looked at these methods using a
[spreadsheet example](Map reduce filter.xls)

A set of unit tests are provided.
